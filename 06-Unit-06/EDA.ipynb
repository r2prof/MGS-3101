    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a systematic process of examining data to understand its structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and generate hypotheses for further modeling. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Project Setup and Context\n",
    "- Define the business question or analytical objective.  \n",
    "- Identify data sources and collection methods.  \n",
    "- Clarify the unit of analysis (e.g., customer, transaction, product).  \n",
    "- Establish key variables, constraints, and success criteria.  \n",
    "- Set up a reproducible environment with consistent documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Import and Initial Inspection\n",
    "- Load the dataset and verify successful import.  \n",
    "- Examine the structure: rows, columns, and data types.  \n",
    "- Review column names, units, and meanings.  \n",
    "- Obtain initial descriptive statistics to understand central tendencies and dispersion.  \n",
    "- Identify immediate anomalies such as extreme values or unexpected formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Detect and handle missing values appropriately (imputation, deletion, flagging).  \n",
    "- Identify and remove duplicate records.  \n",
    "- Correct incorrect or inconsistent data types.  \n",
    "- Standardize text and categorical entries for uniformity.  \n",
    "- Verify the integrity and consistency of key identifiers or primary keys.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Univariate Analysis\n",
    "- Explore each variable individually to understand its distribution and variability.  \n",
    "- For numerical variables, analyze mean, median, skewness, and kurtosis.  \n",
    "- For categorical variables, examine frequency distributions and category proportions.  \n",
    "- Identify potential outliers or unusual patterns.  \n",
    "- Use visualizations such as histograms and boxplots conceptually to interpret data shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "- Study relationships between two variables to uncover associations or dependencies.  \n",
    "- Examine numerical–numerical relationships using correlation and scatterplots.  \n",
    "- Examine categorical–categorical associations using cross-tabulations or contingency tables.  \n",
    "- For numerical–categorical pairs, compare group-level statistics such as means and variances.  \n",
    "- Evaluate potential cause–effect relationships with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Multivariate Analysis\n",
    "- Investigate interactions among three or more variables simultaneously.  \n",
    "- Explore patterns using correlation matrices or multivariate visualizations.  \n",
    "- Summarize complex data through pivot tables or clustering techniques.  \n",
    "- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) for interpretability when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Outlier Detection and Treatment\n",
    "- Identify data points that significantly deviate from typical patterns.  \n",
    "- Use statistical rules (e.g., IQR or Z-score) to flag potential outliers.  \n",
    "- Assess whether outliers represent data entry errors or meaningful variability.  \n",
    "- Decide on suitable actions—retain, adjust, or remove—based on business context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Feature Engineering and Transformation\n",
    "- Create new variables that capture important relationships or improve interpretability.  \n",
    "- Combine, aggregate, or transform existing features (e.g., ratios, differences, flags).  \n",
    "- Encode categorical variables using label or one-hot encoding.  \n",
    "- Scale or normalize numerical variables for uniform magnitude.  \n",
    "- Address skewed distributions through mathematical transformations (e.g., log, square root).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Correlation and Statistical Testing\n",
    "- Measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.  \n",
    "- Evaluate correlation among numerical variables (Pearson or Spearman methods).  \n",
    "- Apply hypothesis tests (chi-square, t-test, ANOVA) for statistical significance.  \n",
    "- Identify potential multicollinearity that could affect modeling stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Data Visualization\n",
    "- Use visual tools to identify trends, patterns, and relationships intuitively.  \n",
    "- Select visualization types appropriate for variable types and analysis goals.  \n",
    "- Communicate findings clearly with proper titles, legends, and labels.  \n",
    "- Focus on interpretability rather than complexity—clarity is key.  \n",
    "- Consider both static and interactive approaches for storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Dimensionality and Multicollinearity Check\n",
    "- Assess redundancy and overlap among predictors.  \n",
    "- Evaluate multicollinearity using diagnostic measures (e.g., Variance Inflation Factor).  \n",
    "- Apply dimensionality reduction if multiple features convey similar information.  \n",
    "- Retain variables that add unique explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Preliminary Insights and Summary\n",
    "- Document major patterns, relationships, and data quality issues identified.  \n",
    "- Highlight business-relevant findings such as key drivers, trends, or anomalies.  \n",
    "- Identify next steps—e.g., variables to retain, transform, or exclude.  \n",
    "- Present concise, interpretable conclusions for nontechnical stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Data Export and Documentation\n",
    "- Save the cleaned and processed dataset for modeling or further analysis.  \n",
    "- Record every transformation or cleaning decision for reproducibility.  \n",
    "- Create a concise data dictionary describing each variable and its meaning.  \n",
    "- Maintain version control and ensure consistent data lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Automated EDA (Optional)\n",
    "- Leverage automated profiling tools to accelerate exploration.  \n",
    "- Use dashboards or generated reports to summarize distributions, correlations, and missingness.  \n",
    "- Validate automated insights with manual checks for accuracy.  \n",
    "- Integrate automated EDA results into formal documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis is not a mechanical step but a **strategic process** of discovery.  \n",
    "It helps analysts build intuition about their data, detect underlying relationships, and ensure data readiness for modeling.  \n",
    "Every decision—from cleaning to visualization—should be **guided by business context and analytical rigor**.\n",
